What is BMS for?
----------------

BMS stands for "Block Model Simulator". It helps defining a DynamicalSystem, a collection of variables linked by equations or behaviors.

The values of the model's variables are computed by the model and can be displayed or post-treated.

Here is for example the output of an electric motor model:
