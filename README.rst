BMSpy: Block-Model Simulator for python
--------

BMS is a block model time simulator: it computes time values of functions (called variables) linked by blocks which represent equations and behaviors between them.

A model (class DynamicSystem) contains blocks, which contains the variables.

Some examples on how defining the model and working with the results are provided in the examples/ folder on github: https://github.com/masfaraud/BMSpy/tree/master/bms/examples

Only a few blocks are currently available. Feel free to request for relevant blocks or input functions!
