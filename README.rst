BMSpy: Block-Model Simulator for python
=======================================

BMS is a block model time simulator: it computes time values of time functions (called variables) linked by blocks which represent equations and behaviors between them.
A model (class DynamicSystem) contains blocks, which contains the variables.

BMS is designed as a lightweight, fully scriptable, open-source equivalent to simulink in python.
